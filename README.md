Certainly! Here are the descriptions for each of the tasks from your point of view, reflecting that you have successfully implemented them:

### TASK 1: Number Game

In this task, I have created an exciting number guessing game. The game boasts the following features:

1. I've programmed it to generate a random number within a specified range, such as 1 to 100.
2. It prompts the user to enter their guess for the generated number.
3. The game compares the user's guess with the generated number and provides instant feedback on whether the guess is correct, too high, or too low.
4. I've made sure the game repeats steps 2 and 3 until the user guesses the correct number.

I've also gone the extra mile by adding some additional features:

- I've set a limit on the number of attempts the user has to guess the number.
- I've included the option for multiple rounds, allowing the user to enjoy the game repeatedly.
- Users can now see their score, which is based on either the number of attempts taken or rounds won.

### TASK 2: Student Grade Calculator

In this task, I've developed a program that calculates and displays the grades of students based on their exam scores. The program offers the following capabilities:

1. It takes marks obtained (out of 100) in each subject as input.
2. I've programmed it to calculate the total marks by adding up the marks obtained in all subjects.
3. It calculates the average percentage by dividing the total marks by the total number of subjects.
4. Based on the average percentage achieved, the program assigns grades to students.
5. The results are then displayed, showing the total marks, average percentage, and corresponding grade.

### TASK 3: ATM Interface

In this task, I've designed and implemented a user-friendly ATM (Automated Teller Machine) interface. The program offers a range of functions:

1. I've created a class to represent the ATM machine.
2. I designed an intuitive user interface for the ATM, offering options such as withdrawing, depositing, and checking the balance.
3. I've implemented methods for each option, such as `withdraw(amount)`, `deposit(amount)`, and `checkBalance()`.
4. There's also a class to represent the user's bank account, securely storing the account balance.
5. I've seamlessly connected the ATM class with the user's bank account class to provide access to and modification of the account balance.
6. I've taken care of input validation, ensuring that user input is within acceptable limits (e.g., sufficient balance for withdrawals).
7. Users receive clear and informative messages based on their chosen options and the outcome of their transactions.

### TASK 5: Student Management System

In this task, I've developed a comprehensive Student Management System, simplifying the management of student data. The program covers various aspects:

1. I've crafted a `Student` class to represent individual students, complete with attributes like name, roll number, grade, and other pertinent details.
2. To manage the collection of students, I've implemented a `StudentManagementSystem` class, equipped with methods for adding, removing, searching for, and displaying students.
3. Users can interact with the system through a well-designed user interface, whether it's console-based or a graphical interface using libraries like Swing or JavaFX.
4. I've ensured seamless data management by implementing methods to read and write student data to a storage medium, such as a file or a database.
5. The system offers users various options, including adding new students, editing existing student information, searching for students, displaying all students, and exiting the application.
6. Robust input validation has been incorporated to guarantee that required fields are not left empty and that student data adheres to the correct format.

These tasks have been successfully implemented, providing a feature-rich and user-friendly experience for our project.
